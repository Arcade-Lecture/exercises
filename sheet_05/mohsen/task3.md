| The postfix increment operator ++ evaluates to the value a for a++.                                                                                                     | X    |       |                                                                                     |
| The expression --a is equivalent to a -= 1.                                                                                                                             | X    |       |                                                                                     |
| If foo is a function name, then the expression foo() results in apointer to the function foo.                                                                           |      | X     | foo ..... not foo()                                                                 |
| Assume a,b as lvalues of number type, then (i + j) is a rvalue.                                                                                                         | X    |       |                                                                                     |
| The storage class static leads to automatic storage duration and internal linkage.                                                                                      |      | X     | leads to static storage duration                                                    |
| A memory leak may occur when allocated storage duration is used.                                                                                                        | X    |       |                                                                                     |
| Given two structs struct s1, and struct s2 in the samescope. C disallows to assign the same identifier x to members ins1 and s2 (i.e., s1.x and s2.x is always invalid) |      | X     | every x lies with in a different scope so, no harm when using x with s1 or with s2. |
| The type cast operator (type) has the same precedence as prefixincrement operator in C.                                                                                 | X    |       |                                                                                     |
| The expression a << b results true iff a is less but not equal to b.                                                                                                    |      | X     | because  << is not a comparision operator it is just bitwise operation              |
