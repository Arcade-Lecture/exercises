I will be using CLION for this course as it was suggested. 

Reasons for selecting CLION(apart from the above one)

1. I have used eclipse for JAVA developement and after a certain time with lot of plugins it becomes difficult to manage or port to a different machine.

2. According to CLION webpage it boasts a fully integrated c++ dev environment, which most modern IDEs do with some variations. I specifically choose this because most of the tools I want in an IDE eg. test framework, git, terminal support, editor customization etc. are already built in.

3. Look and feel of the IDE is pleasing.
