Why GCC?

- it is an easy and  widely used compiler for C on Linux systems and 
will work even on Windows
- it can compile not only C but also multiple other Languages like C++
- it is a good general purpose compiler, more than enough for our plans 
in this lecture

Why not?

- on highly on performance relying systems(embedded and security) GCC 
may not be customizable enough compiler and can result in loss of performance
-> but since this is not relevant for this lecture GCC will be used
