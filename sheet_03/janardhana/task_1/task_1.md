# Task 1

## Scrum Process

Scrum can be applied to a team size of three or more. It mainly follows sprint i.e, a time-period of two or four weeks 
during which a “Done”, useable,potentially releasable product increment is created. Firstly, the product owner along with 
scrum master prioritizes the requirements needed in the product, he/she is responsible for the product backlog management, including its content,
availability and ordering. The product backlog is ordered list of everything that might be needed in the product it is dynamic,
it constantly changes as per product needs, to be compititive and useful. Product backlog exists as long as product exists. 
The prioritized tasks in backlog are pulled into sprint backlog during Sprint planning, which is a short event in which scrum master 
ensures that team understands the purpose and helps the scrum team undersatand product backlog items to keep it within time frame(Sprint). 
After the tasks are distributed within the team the progress is tracked by standup meetings which can be daily or weekly. Daily scrum meetings
usually takes place for 15 minutes and weekly will be hourly respectively. By the end of the sprint, product increment(sum of all product backlog
items completed during a sprint and the value of the increments of all previous sprints) should be obtained, the new increment must be 
"Done" and must be in usable condition. The increment is inspected in sprint review, this is informal meeting where scrum team and stakeholders
collaborate to see what was done in the sprint and any changes to product backlog during the sprint. In this meeting product owner
explains what product backlog items have been done and what has not, development team discusses what went well during the sprint, what problems
they ran into and how were those tackled and also demonstrates the "Done". The entire group collaborates what to do next so the sprint review
is input to subsequent sprint planning. After sprint review and before sprint planning, sprint retrospective is conducted where team 
discusses what went well in the sprint and what can be improved. Scrum master encourages team to improve its development process and practices.

**How does Feature driven development differs from scrum?**

**FDD**
1. Includes iterative release cycles, requires development of overall domain to understand scope of the application
2. Team builds feature list and are assigned to iterative release cycles
3. Feature teams are assigned to set of features and proceed to design 
4. Team has period of 1 or 2 weeks to complete the feature
5. Development and testing of those feature are carried out, the features are
released to main build when cheif programmer approves.

**Scrum**
1. Is an iterative increment framework
2. Product owner creates prioritized wish list called product backlog
3. Chunk of items from backlog is assigned to developers during planning
4. Team has period of 2 or 4 weeks to complete the tasks
5. Development and testing is carried out, the increment is "Done" once
the done tasks are demoed to stakeholders and agreed.

Scrum can be applied,
where there is continuous change in requirement, because feedback loops are shorter in scrum. 
Handling big project requires the project to be split into modules/ sub modules that can be managed as a seperate 
project. Such projects should be executed with scrums.
And also project needing prioritized tasks to be "done" irrespective of any other tasks in backlog.

As name suggests it can be used for feature driven projects,
where entire problem can be divided into small features and each feature can be accomplished in a certain time frame. 
Best suited for project involving less communication, since feature are decided in advance.
