	created for
	- it is usefull if the processing of the templates is
	similar

Structural Pattern- adapter:

	- defines a family of alogrithms
	- makes the algorithms in a family interchangeable
	
Concurrency pattern-scheduling:

	- work specified by some means is assigned to resources that complete the work
	The work may be virtual computation elements such as threads,
	 processes or data flows, wich are in turn scheduled
	 onto hardware resources such as processors,
	 network links or expanision cards
