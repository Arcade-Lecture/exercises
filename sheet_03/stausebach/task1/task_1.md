# 1, Kanban

	## Definition :
	+ Kanban is a method for visualizing the flow of work, in order to balance demand with available capacity.
	+ Work items are visualized to give participants a view of progress and process, from start to finish.
	+ Team members pull work as capacity permits, rather than work being pushed into the process when requested.
	+ Kanban is an approach to process change for organizations which uses visualization with a kanban board, allowing a better understanding of work and workflow

## Elements :

	  + ##### Kanban boards
	    The work of all kanban teams revolves around a kanban board, a tool used to visualize work and optimize the flow of the work among the team.
	    A basic kanban board has a three-step workflow: To Do, In Progress, and Done. However, depending on a team's size, structure, and objectives, the workflow can be mapped to meet the unique process of any particular team.
	    + ##### Kanban cards
	    The main purpose of representing work as a card on the kanban board is to allow team members to track the progress of work through its workflow in a highly visual manner.
	    Kanban cards feature critical information about that particular work item, giving the entire team full visibility into who is responsible for that item of work, a brief description of the job being done, how long that piece of work is estimated to take, and so on

## Principles :
	  + Start with what you do now
	    - The Kanban Method does not ask you to change your process. It is based on the concept that you evolve your current process. There is no sweeping, engineered change to a new process definition or style of working.
	  + Agree to pursue incremental, evolutionary change
	    - The organization (or team) must agree that their current circumstances warrant a gentle, evolutionary approach to improvement.
	  + Respect the current process, roles, responsibilities & titles
	    - It is likely that, what the organization currently does, has some elements that work acceptably and are worth preserving. We must also seek to drive out fear in order to facilitate future change.
	  + Visualize the workflow
	  + Limit WIP
	    - Limiting WIP implies that we implement a pull system on part or all of the workflow
	  + Manage Flow
	    - The flow of work items through each state in the workflow should be monitored and reported - often referred to as Measuring Flow. By flow we mean movement. We are interested in the speed of movement and the smoothness of that movement.
	  + Make Process Policies Explicit
	    - Until the mechanism of software development or IT operations process is made explicit it is often hard or impossible to hold a discussion about improving it
	  + Improve Collaboratively (using models & the scientific method)
	    - It is the WIP limit that ultimately stimulates conversations about process problems. Things which impede flow, or introduce perturbations that mean flow is inconsistent or ragged, often result in a challenge to the WIP limit. The team has the option to break the limit, ignore the problem and carry on, or to face up to the issue, discuss it and suggest a change.

	### sprint
	  + sprint is a set period of time during which specific work has to be completed and made ready for review.
	### planning
	  + is the process of thinking about and organizing the activities required to achieve a desired goal. It involves the creation and maintenance of a plan, such as psychological aspects that require conceptual skills.
	### meeting
	  + to discuss what need to do
	### product
	  + a set of feature
	### feature
	  + necessary function to be implement
	### assignment to sprint
	  + At the beginning of your sprint you should have a sprint planning meeting. This is where your team decides which user stories to deliver that sprint. At the end of the meeting you should have a reasonable and prioritized sprint backlog.
	### back log
	  + The agile product backlog in Scrum is a prioritized features list, containing short descriptions of all functionality desired in the product. When applying Scrum, it's not necessary to start a project with a lengthy, upfront effort to document all requirements.
	### daily scrum meeting
	  + Each day during the sprint, a brief meeting called the daily scrum is conducted. This meeting helps set the context for each day’s work and helps the team stay on track. All team members are required to attend the daily scrum.
	### release
	  + A very high-level plan for multiple Sprints (e.g. three to twelve iteration) is created during the Release planning. It is a guideline that reflects expectations about which features will be implemented and when they are completed. It also serves as a base to monitor progress within the project.
	### increment
	  + The Product Increment is the sum of all Product Backlog items completed during a Sprint and all previous Sprints. At the end of a Sprint the new Product Increment must be in a usable condition and meet the Scrum Team's Definition of Done.
	### sprint review
	  + At the end of each sprint, the team demonstrates the completed functionality at a sprint review meeting, during which, the team shows what they accomplished during the sprint. Typically, this takes the form of a demonstration of the new features, but in an informal way; for example, PowerPoint slides are not allowed. The meeting must not become a task in itself nor a distraction from the process.
	### product backlog:
	  + The product backlog is a prioritized features list containing every desired feature or change to the product. Note: The term “backlog” can get confusing because it’s used for two different things. To clarify, the product backlog is a list of desired features for the product. The sprint backlog is a list of tasks to be completed in a sprint.
	### prioritization:
	  + All entries are prioritized and the Scrum Product Backlog is ordered. The Scrum Product Owner with the help of the Scrum Team does the prioritization. Added Value, Costs and Risks are the most common factors for prioritization. With this prioritization the Scrum Product Owner decides what should be done next.
	### scrum master:
	  + The Scrum Master is responsible for making sure the team is as productive as possible. The Scrum Master does this by helping the team use the Scrum process, by removing impediments to progress, by protecting the team from outside, and so on.
	### product owner:
	  + The product owner is the project’s key stakeholder and represents users, customers and others in the process. The product owner is often someone from product management or marketing, a key stakeholder or a key user.
	### team :
	  + A typical scrum team has between five and nine people, but Scrum projects can easily scale into the hundreds. However, Scrum can easily be used by one-person teams and often is. This team does not include any of the traditional software engineering roles such as programmer, designer, tester or architect. Everyone on the project works together to complete the set of work they have collectively committed to complete within a sprint. Scrum teams develop a deep form of camaraderie and a feeling that “we’re all in this together.”


# Srum vs Kanban

	+ Looking at both agile software development methodologies it should be more clear what to introduce when: If your organization is really stuck and needs a fundamental shift towards a more efficient process, Scrum seems to be more appropiate. If you already have working processes, which you want to improve over time without shaking up the whole system, Kanban should be your tool of choice.
