## Pattern with UML Diagram

### Creational pattern: Factory Method
A Factory Method is used to create a desired object without calling the regarding real constructor and receiving the desired object like a real constructor call

### Structural pattern: Adapter
An adapter pattern is used to enable the usage of a seperate system through an interface, allowing the program to use the already existing implementation without modifying the current own data structure

### Behavioural pattern: Observer
An observer pattern is used for example to control individual instances of one main class to shared variables which are not linked per reference

### Concurrency pattern: event-based async
Describes a service which can always receives tasks and send them further to subworkers to enable a realtime task solving ability, eliminates unnecessary waiting time of the program

### Architectual pattern: data access object
Describes the middleman between a program and a database allowing the program to work unrelated to the current DBMS, the Data access object also allows the database to be physically switched and still enable the program to work
