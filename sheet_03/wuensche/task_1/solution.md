## Softwaremanagement - SCRUM
---
### Definition

SCRUM is a software development method typically chosen for a agile, iterative, incremental and prototype heavy process. It has been around for a few years now and proved itself to be a reliant method of team management. Main trade marks of it are the collection of tasks into a backlog which includes the user stories, describing the tasks from an user-orientated view ,separation of the user stories in to sprints, which are used to develop single or multiple features completely to be included into a functioning prototype. Smaller elements in SCRUM are daily stand-up meetings, sprint-reviews, sprint-completion.

### Process overview
_a) sprint _
```
monthly colllection of user stories typically completed within a month and added to the prototyp, it contains(meetings, a feature to be completed, a sprint log, daily scrum meetings, and at the end a sprint review)
```
_b) planning_
```
before every sprint the planned features that should be completed must be chosen in order to avoid chaos during the sprint this is typically done at the end of the previous sprint or if it's the first one in the inital planning phase, while initial planning the backlog is created
```
_c) meeting_
```
is an essential part of SCRUM, it can be found inside the sprints as the daily stand-up meetings intended to report the progress of the previous day as well as solving potential problems that occured or will occur in further development and outside of sprints as sprint reviews, and presentation to main stakeholders to report about the progress made
```
_d) product_
```
is the ongoing subject for all sprints(adding of features) and planning phases, completion rate an be used as an indicator for progress
```
_e) feature_
```
are implemented during sprints(subject of the sprint) and added afterwards completely to the main prototype
```
_f) assignment to sprint_
```
user stories will be assigned to certain sprints depending on their more general categories and subject of the planned sprints
```
_g) backlog(assuming sprint backlog)_
```
extract of a few selected user stories from the product backlog, meant to be completed during the sprint and inserted into the prototype afterwards
```
_h) daily scrum meetings_
```
daily stand-up meetings intended to report the progress of the previous day as well as solving potential problems that occured or will occur in further development(see meetings)
```
_i) release_
```
state of the project reached after completing all sprints and finish debugging and testing phase
```
_j) increment_
```
finished features of sprints will be added to the already functioning prototype resulting in a new one, making it an incremental development prototype
```
_k) sprint review_
```
done after completing a sprint to summarize the work that has been done, unfinished user stories, potential bugs and statistics of the team performance
```
_l) product backlog_
```
contains all user stories created at the beginning of the development, basically the feature list for the finished product
```
_m) prioritization_
```
describes the practice of ordering the product backlog user stories regarding to their importance in comparison with the other user stories(upper stories more important than lower)
```
_n) scrum master_
```
person responsible for a functioning documentation and for communication and organization with the team, organizer within the sprints
```
_o) product owner_
```
stake holder of the project, main profiteur of a finished and functioning product
```
_p) team_
```
developer of the software, self managed unit with equal importance to the other two roles of influence, operator within the sprints
```

### Comparison with Waterfall Model
The Models main commonalities lie within their extensive planning phase at the beginning, they both have a document containing all planned features, but while SCRUM can be altered afterwards the Waterfall Model does not support this kind of change. Further difference exist in the creation process of the product while WFM depends on a one step development, SCRUM uses an incremental iterative development. The WFM is a product oriented, mainly for smaller projects used development method, SCRUM can be used for larger and longer projects with an orientation for a user friendly development approach.


### Areas of expertise for the two models
SCRUM:
- user oriented software development
- development with new technologies
- development for new customers

WFM:
- research and development department
- development for known technologies
- small projects
