## Softwaremanagement - SCRUATSCH
---
### Definition

SCRUM is a software development method typically chosen for a agile, iterative, incremental and prototype heavy process. It has been around for a few years now and proved itself to be a reliant method of team management. Main trade marks of it are the collection of tasks into a backlog which includes the user stories, describing the tasks from an user-orientated view ,separation of the user stories in to sprints, which are used to develop single or multiple features completely to be included into a functioning prototype. Smaller elements in SCRUM are daily stand-up meetings, sprint-reviews, sprint-completion.

### Process overview
_a) sprint _
```
monthly colllection of user stories typically completed within a month and added to the prototyp
```
_b) planning_
```
before every sprint the planned features that should be completed must be chosen in order to avoid chaos during the sprint this is typically done at the end of the previous sprint or if it's the first one in the inital planning phase
```
_c) meeting_
```
is an essential part of SCRUM, it can be found inside the sprints as the daily stand-up meetings intended to report the progress of the previous day as well as solving potential problems that occured or will occur in further development
```
_d) product_
```
is the ongoing subject for all sprints and planning phases, progress can be measured at the completion rate of it
```
_e) feature_
```
are implemented during sprints and added afterwards completely to the main prototype
```
_f) assignment to sprint_
```
user stories will be assigned to certain sprints depending on their more general categories and subject of the planned sprints
```
_g) back log_
```
holds all user stories of the project
```
_h) daily scrum meetings_
```
see meetings
```
_i) release_
```
state of the project reached after completing all sprints and finish debugging and testing phase
```
_j) increment_
```
finished features of sprints will be added to the already functioning prototype resulting in a new one, making it an incremental development prototype
```
_k) sprint review_
```
done after completing a sprint to summarize the work that has been done, unfinished user stories, potential bugs and statistics of the team performance
```
_l) product backlog_
```
see back log, TODO fix that
```
_m) prioritization_
```

```
_n) scrum master_
```
person responsible for a functioning documentation and for communication and organization with the team
```
_o) product owner_
```
stake holder of the project, main profiteur of a finished and functioning product
```
_p) team_
```
developer of the software, self managed unit with equal importance to the other two roles of influence
