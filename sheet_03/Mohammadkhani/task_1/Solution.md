##### 1- Give a statement why you pick this particular method and why not another one!
**Answer:** Deleted after the first review
##### 2- Give a definition (or at least an in-depth description) on what the characters of your particular method is! State the purpose and the principles you chosen development method!
**Answer:** Scrum is a framework for managing software development. It is designed for teams of three to nine developers who break their work into actions that can be completed within fixed duration cycles (called "sprints"), track progress and re-plan in daily 15-minute stand-up meetings, and collaborate to deliver workable software every sprint.

##### 3- Provide an overview on the processes and their connections to each other!
**Answer:** 
The Scrum framework would be like this:
* A product owner creates a prioritized wish list called a product backlog. 
* During sprint planning, the team pulls a small chunk from the top of that wish list, a sprint backlog, and decides how to implement those pieces. 
* The team has a certain amount of time — a sprint (usually two to four weeks) — to complete its work, but it meets each day to assess its progress (daily Scrum). 
* Along the way, the ScrumMaster keeps the team focused on its goal. 
* At the end of the sprint, the work should be potentially shippable: ready to hand to a customer, put on a store shelf, or show to a stakeholder. 
* The sprint ends with a sprint review and retrospective. 
* As the next sprint begins, the team chooses another chunk of the product backlog and begins working again.


During the Scrum Framework three roles are defined: The Scrum Team, Scrum Master, Scrum Product Owner. Each of these roles has a defined set of responsibilities and only if they fulfill these responsibilities, closely interact and work together they can finish a project successfully.

The heart of Scrum is a **_Sprint_**, a time-box of one month or less during which a “Done”, useable, and potentially releasable product Increment is created. 
The work to be performed in the Sprint is planned at the **_Sprint Planning_**. This plan is created by the collaborative work of the entire Scrum Team. Sprint Planning is time-boxed to a maximum of eight hours for a one-month Sprint. For shorter Sprints, the event is usually shorter. The Scrum Master ensures that the event takes place and that attendants understand its purpose. Sprint Planning answers the following:
- What can be delivered in the Increment resulting from the upcoming Sprint?
- How will the work needed to deliver the Increment be achieved?

**_Scrum meetings_** happen at particular points in the sprint cycle. It has 4 types: 
1. daily Scrum meeting
2. sprint planning meeting
3. sprint retrospective meeting
4. sprint review meeting

In most cases, it would seem straightforward to identify an organization’s **_products_**. For example, a watch manufacturer might think of each item they sell as a product. I define a product as something (physical or not) that is created through a process and that provides benefits to a market. From that, a chair would be a product. Microsoft Office would be a product. Agile consulting services would be a product.

A **_feature_** is a distinct element of functionality which can provide capabilities to the business. For instance, a feature might be "allow users to comment on articles". 

**_Assigning tasks_** can be overt or subtle. Scrum Teams are self-organizing. Self-organizing teams choose how best to accomplish their work, rather than being directed by others outside the team. At the start of sprint, everyone volunteer for an initial task. If someone didn’t her/his job, The ScrumMaster of the team, chooses a retrospective technique that is designed to help the team address the problem. 

**_Backlog_** is an accumulation of uncompleted work or matters needing to be dealt with.

In the simplest definition the **_Scrum Product Backlog_** is simply a list of all things that needs to be done within the project. These items can have a technical nature or can be user-centric.

**_Daily Scrum meeting_** is meant to be consistent – same place and time each day, preferably in the morning. Further, they are meant to be no longer than 15 minutes. The meeting is for the entire team, including the Scrum Master and product owner.

**_Releases_** are created by a product owner and contain user stories, sometimes from multiple products, that form the release backlog. A release is bounded by start and end times and is used to organize the effort of the release teams working on user stories. Typically, the product owner creates the release teams and decides when the release is complete enough for delivery to a customer.

The **_Increment_** is the sum of all the Product Backlog items completed during a Sprint and the value of the increments of all previous Sprints. 

A **_Sprint Review_** is held at the end of the Sprint to inspect the Increment and adapt the Product Backlog if needed. During the Sprint Review, the Scrum Team and stakeholders collaborate about what was done in the Sprint. Based on that and any changes to the Product Backlog during the Sprint, attendees collaborate on the next things that could be done to optimize value.

Broad speaking it is the job of the **_Scrum Master_** to ensure that the Scrum Team adheres to the Scrum theory, practices and rules.
The Scrum Master is part of the Scrum Team and acts as a servant-leader for the Scrum Team. In the beginning this will be a full-time job so that the Scrum Master will not be able to directly contribute to the Sprint results. However after some Sprints the processes will settle so that the workload for the Scrum Master will drop and he could actively contribute to the Sprint Goal.
 
Since it is crucial that there is trust between the Scrum Master and the other team members it would be ideal if the Scrum Team selects the Scrum Master itself. However, in reality most often the Management selects the Scrum Master. To get the required trust the Scrum Master should have no line-management responsibility for one of the team members. Otherwise the necessary open communication and decision finding will be hampered.
 
The Scrum Master has several important responsibilities:
1. Guard the Scrum Team from external requests and disruptions
2. Act as a change agent and adapt processes to maximize productivity of the team
3. Coach the Scrum Team
4. Remove impediments for the Scrum Team
5. Ensure efficient communication between the Scrum Team and the Scrum Product Owner
6. Facilitate the various Scrum Events

 **_The Scrum Product Owner_** is a central role within the Scrum Framework. Most of the responsibilities of the classical product manager and the project manager are combined within this single role.
He represents the end customer and/or other stakeholders and is responsible for maximizing the value of the product by ensuring that the right work is done at the right time.
As a consequence this means of course that the Scrum Product Owner has to work very closely with the Scrum Team and coordinates their activities over the whole lifetime of the project. No one else is allowed to tell the development team to work from a different set of priorities.
 
The Scrum Product Owner has a number of responsibilities:
1. Managing the Scrum Product Backlog
2. Release Management
3. Stakeholder Management
4. Work closely with the Scrum Team

Within the Scrum Framework all work delivered to the customer is done by dedicated **_Scrum Teams_**. A Scrum Team is a collection of individuals working together to deliver the requested and committed product increments.
 
To work effectively it is important for a Scrum Team that everyone within the team:
1. follows a common goal
2. adheres the same norms and rules
3. shows respect to each other

##### 4- Provide a comparison with at least one other development method focusing on commonalities and differences!
**Answer**: I considered _Kanban_ to compare with _Scrum_. 
Kanban is also a tool used to organize work for the sake of efficiency. Like Scrum, Kanban encourages work to be broken down into manageable chunks and uses a Kanban Board (very similar to the Scrum Board) to visualize that work as it progresses through the work flow. Where Scrum limits the amount of time allowed to accomplish a particular amount of work (by means of sprints), Kanban limits the amount of work allowed in any one condition (only so many tasks can be ongoing, only so many can be on the to-do list.)

***commonalities***: Both Scrum and Kanban allow for large and complex tasks to be broken down and completed efficiently. Both place a high value on continual improvement, optimization of the work and the process. And both share the very similar focus on a highly visible work flow that keeps all team members in the loop on WIP and what’s to come.

***differences***: As alluded to above, there are a number of differences in both the philosophy behind and the practical application of Scrum and Kanban. While the individual differences are many, they can be grouped into the following three buckets: 
- Scheduling
- iteration
- cadence
**_Scrum_** processes place heavy emphasis on schedule. The scrum team is provided with a prioritized list of story points that need to be completed to deliver a shippable product. The team must decide how many of the points they feel can be completed within one sprint. Anything outside the scope they commit to must wait for the next sprint. Optimally, an efficient scrum team will quickly learn their capabilities over the course of several sprints and their estimates will improve and be optimized as time goes on. Then, every two weeks (or however long their sprint is) the team produces a shippable product, carries out a retrospective to discuss optimizing the process, and moves into the next sprint. This iterative process is designed to allow for accurate estimations of work flow and effective management of multiple projects. On a **_Kanban_** team, there are no required time boxes or iterations. While the Kanban method is iterative in nature, the continual improvement is expected to occur in an evolutionary fashion as work is continually completed. The limitations placed on various conditions in the work flow will be regulated early in a team’s (or organization’s) use of Kanban until an optimal set of limits is arrived at to keep the flow steady and efficient.

##### 5- Discuss when it is more useful to choose your particular method and the other(s) that you add in (4).
**Answer**: Looking at both agile software development methodologies it should be more clear what to introduce when: If your organization is really stuck and needs a fundamental shift towards a more efficient process, Scrum seems to be more appropriate. If you already have working processes, which you want to improve over time without shaking up the whole system, Kanban should be your tool of choice.
