#Task 1 (Methods for Agile Software Development)

## Task 1.2


>(2) Give a definition (or at least an in-depth description) on what the characters of your
>particular method is! State the purpose and the principles you chosen development
>method!

###SCRUM

is a project managment framework, it is a concrete example of the agile software management methdology, which means it is an iterative and an incremental approach.

The purpose: is to encourage early and continous delivery of the software product, it encourages the team to work independently, doesn't focus too much on management in comparsion with the classical methods of managing software.

it is considered as flexibile, can afford changes in the needs of the software,
encourages communication between the team members.


## Task 1.3

>Provide an overview on the processes and their connections to each other!

>a.sprint:
it is a time duration (week to a month) typically two weeks, by its end a working product is produced.
it begins with a meeting between the product owner and the the developement team and the scrum master,
to discuss what will be implemented during this sprint, ends with a meeting to discuss what is completed and what is not and what to do next.

>b.planning:
during the meeting that is held at the beginning of the sprint, the members gather and plan what will be executed throughout this sprint. typically the product owner determines what features and none functional requirements to be done, the development team views this requirement and determines what can be done during this run.

>c.meeting:
during the scrum process several meetings are held, for example at the beginning of the sprint
there is a planning meeting to determine the outcome of this sprint, during the sprint daily meeting is held to discuss what is done what will be done, and a review meeting at the end of the sprint.

>d.product:
the output of a sprint, the business values of product is determined by the product owner, the technical implementation is done by the team.

>e.feature:
what value shall the product add, is determined by the product owner, it is written in the product log.

>f.assignment to sprint:
at the beginning of the sprint, a meeting is held to determine what will be done, the assignment in terms of what will be done is done during this meeting.

>g.back log
document to describe the work done in a sprint, there are two types of backlogs

1- product backlog:documents managed by the product owner to describe which features is needed during the sprint, in the meeting that is held at the beginning of the sprint, the members gather and plan what will be executed throughout this sprint

2- sprint backlog: held by the development team, in which they transfer the features required by the product manager into tasks.

>h.daily scrum meeting:
is meeting held daily during the sprint, essentially the members shall be the ScrumMaster and the development team, though every one is welcome, the duration is typically 15 minutes, the members shall discuss what is done yesterday, and what they will do, and if there is any restrictions facing them.

>i.release:
the output of a sprint, for each sprint a release is planned, in what is called the release plan note that this plan is static, can change.

>j.increment:
The Increment is the sum of all the Product Backlog items completed during a Sprint and the
value of the increments of all previous Sprints.
source: Scrum guide.


>k.sprint review:
at the end of the sprint a meeting is held at the end of the sprint, review the product backlog, discuss the work done and the work undone, what went through the sprint and what problems they have faced, discuss what to do next, in the next sprint.


>m.prioritization:

at the beginning of the sprint, the product owner priotrise what features to be done during this sprint, then the development team may follow this priotrization, or do the work differently.


>n.scrum master:

member of the scrum team, has the responsibilty to ensure the scrum principles are held, might coach the product owner and the development team to follow the scrum principles, and to handle the obstacles that might arises during work, in contrast to the old methodolgy the scrummaster isn't a leader or a manger.

>o.product owner:

member of the scrum team represents the business interest, works as a proxy between the scrum team and the the stakeholders, reposible for managing the product backlog to describe which features is needed during the sprint, in the meeting that is held at the beginning of the sprint, the members gather and plan what will be executed throughout this sprint. 

>p. development team:

is the team for converting the features in the product backlog to a done product during the sprint,
the team is self managed so the ScrumMaster doesn't tell the team what to do.


## Task 1.4

>(4) Provide a comparison with at least one other development method focusing on
>commonalities and differences!



| Feature | SCRUM | XP |
|------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| similarities | follows the agile methodology by focusing on iteration and increments and early delivery of  a product | follows the agile methodology by focusing oniteration and increments and early delivery of a product |
| iteration period | one week to a month | short iteratio perdiod typically a week |
| adaptability | changes during the sprint isn't allowed | changes during the iteration is allowed |
| application area | it is generic framework, could be applied to  other projects, rather than software projects | focuses on the area of software projects, by encouraging practises such as test driven development, pair programming...  |


>## Task 1.5 

>(5) Discuss when it is more useful to choose your particular method and the other(s) that
>you add in (4).

it is more useful to the XP, when the changes with the sprint is required

otherwise scrum is would be more useful
