#Task 1 (Methods for Agile Software Development)

## Task 1.2

>Give a definition (or at least an in-depth description) on what the characters >of your particular method is! State the purpose and the principles you chosen >development method!

The method I have chosen is SCRUM.

> Definition:

SCRUM is a framework for managing software projects, it is a concrete example of
agile software development methodeligy, which by its return means it is an incremental and also iterative approach.

> Characteristics:

So SCRUM focuses on having small teams may be from 3 to 9 persons.
SCRUM encourage the principle of having a working product as early as possible
Using the term sprints, sprint could be thought of as a defined time period to have a working product typically from a week to a month.

SCRUM also encourages the concept of face to face communication by having a daily meeting of the different scrum members.

> Purpose and Principles:

So the main reason I have chosen Scrum is because it is a successful framework,
flexible to changes, provides a working product as nearly as possible, it also encourage the development team to be self driven, which if the team is skilled
can produces very good results, without wasting excessive time on management and so on.


## Task 1.2

>Provide an overview on the processes and their connections to each other!

## Task 1.4



1-Scrum teams typically work in iterations (called sprints) that are from two weeks to one month long. XP teams typically work in   iterations  that are one or two weeks long.
   
2-Scrum teams do not allow changes into their sprints. Once the sprint planning meeting is completed and a commitment made to delivering a set of product backlog items, that set of items remains unchanged through the end of the sprint. XP teams are much more amenable to change within their iterations. As long as the team hasn’t started work on a particular feature, a new feature of equivalent size can be swapped into the XP team’s iteration in exchange for the unstarted feature.

3-Extreme Programming teams work in a strict priority order. Features to be developed are prioritized by the customer (Scrum’s Product Owner) and the team is required to work on them in that order. By contrast, the Scrum product owner prioritizes the product backlog but the team determines the sequence in which they will develop the backlog items. I’ve never seen a Scrum team not choose to work on the highest-priority item. And a Scrum team will very likely choose to work on the second most important. However, at some point one of the high priority items may not be a good fit for the sprint being planned—maybe a key person who should work on it will be swamped by work on higher priority items. Or maybe it makes sense to work on a slightly lower priority item (let’s say #10 on the product backlog instead of #6) because the team will be working in the code where #10 would be implemented.

4-Scrum doesn’t prescribe any engineering practices; XP does.

## Task 1.5 

it is more useful to the XP, when the changes with the sprint is required

otherwise scrum is would be more useful
