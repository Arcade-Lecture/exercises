## Softwaremanagement - SCRUM
---
### Definition

SCRUM is a software development method. It is agile, iterative, incremental and includes much prototyping. It is a couple of years old and right now one of the most important team management techniques. SCRUM has a killerfeature, which is named backlog. It contains all user stories, merging user stories into sprints to develop features. There are also small artefacts as aily stand-up meetings, sprint-reviews and sprint-completion.

### Process overview

See Mindmap.

### Comparison with Waterfall Model

The biggest difference between WFM and SCRUM are their planning phases at the beginning. They both have a document with all planned features, but WFM does not support changes to this document at all after starting the development. Also WFM does one step of actual development from start to end, SCRUM does support iterative development. WFM can be used in smaller projects, but SCRUM is inevitable for bigger projects.


### Areas of expertise for the two models

SCRUM:
	- Products with Customers
	- Customer Changes Welcome
	- New Techniques (maybe unknown difficulties)

WFM:
	- Small Projects
	- Projects in Sciene with a fixed goal.
