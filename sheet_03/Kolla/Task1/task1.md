Scrum is an popular Agile Software development framework, for managing product development. Scrum helps team deliver customer value early & often in a highly predictable manner. It is an iterative and incremental software development.

##Purpose of Scrum:

- Scrum is an Adaptive, fast, flexible and effective for software development
- Ensures transparency in communication.
- Creates collective accountability and progress.
- Supports all kinds of projects.

##Principles of Scrum:

The principles of scrum to ensure effective implementation of the agile scrum framework. 
These are:

1. Empirical Process Control: 

It emphasis the core principles of scrum based on 3 key ideas.(i.e,)
* Transparency
* Inspection
* Adaption

2. Self-Oraganization:

It focuses on today's workers who deliver significantly greater value, when they had self-organise rather than command and control.

3. Collaboration:

Focus on 3 core dimensions related to to collaborative work.
* Awareness
* Articulation
* Appropriation

4. Value Based Prioritization:

It focuses on scrum to deliver maximum business value beginning early in the project and continuing through out.

5. Time Boxing: 

- Time Boxing emphasis time is considered a limiting constraint in scrum.
- It helps effectively manage project planning and excution.
- Time Box elements include,
* Sprints
* Daily Standup Meetings
* Sprint Planning Meetings
* Sprint Review Meetings

6. Iterative Development:

This principle defines iterative development and emphasis how to better manage changes and build projects that satify customer needs.


(3) The terms and roles of Scrum framework.

1. Product:

Product means developing a new product (or) existing product , may be service.

2. Feature:

A feature is a distinct element of functionality which can provide capabilities to the business.

3. Backlog:

The backlog means the user stories (or) requirements defined by stakeholders and which are to be developed to a product. These are two types:
- Product Backlog
- Sprint Backlog.

4. Product Backlog:

The product Backlog are requirements or User stories which are defined by the stakeholders (or) customers for a specific product.

5. Prioritization:

The product owner will prioritize the product backlog items. The product backlog prioritization depends on importance of the stories.

6. Product Owner:

* Responsible for maximizing the business value delievered by the team.
* Responsible for the product backlog and prioritization of backlog.
* Looks after the work done by the team.
* He accepts or rejects the work done by the team.
* Motivates the team to complete the work in defined time period.

7. Scrum Master:

* Responsible for factilitating the scrum process and ensuring the team is delievering value.
* Removes impedents 
* Builds the self-organizing teams.
* Responsible for meetings in the team

8. Team:

* Responsible for developing the product backlog items into increments of value in each sprint.
* Deliver value in small chunks.
* Focused on customer, build in quality.

9. Sprint: 

A sprint is the fixed time period in which the team have to develop, some of the product backlog items. A sprints lasts for 2-4 weeks.

10. Planning:

Before starting a sprint, requires a sprint planning that helps to prioritize the backlog by involving the product owner, scrum master and team. Later team will decide which have to be done first in those backlog.

11. Assignment to Sprint:

In sprint planning, the backlog items will be assigned in the team to develop and show to the product owner and scrum master.

12. Daily Scrum Meeting:

It is an get together internally evry day for 10-15 minutes. In the meeting, they will discuss these questions:
* What they have completed yesterday?
* What they have to work today?
* what is slowing down them?

13. Sprint Review:

After evrey sprint, there will be a sprint review for show casing what they have developed and what they have not yet completed? They discuss what have to be done in next sprint.

14. Increment:

The increment is defined as the product backlog items completed during the sprint. The product increments means integrating the work and must be fully usable to the customers.

15. Release:

Depending on customer demands, release will be done. The release may be after one or more  sprints i.e, after integrating the product.

(4) Comparison of Scrum and Extreme Programming frameworks:

Scrum                                       | Extreme Programming
---
Iterations are lasts for 2-4 weeks | Teams work in iterations 1-2 weeks.   
Teams don't allow change to the sprint, which was set of product backlog items. | Team can change feature as long as feature hasn't started.
Focus is on the team, team self organizing and cross functional. | Focus on engineering practices as test driven development & pair programming.
Scrum Team can determine which items have to be done. | Feature prioritization is done by customer.
