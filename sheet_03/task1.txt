Extreme Programming :

(2) Definition and principles

- It is an approach to continously deliver software iterations in a very short time
- It promotes feedbacks and working very close to customer 
- communication and feedback plays  the vital role in the approach
- It typically delivers the software high frequently such as in 1-3 weeks.

(3) Overview on Processes (Relations in braces to the corresponding process)

(4) Commonalities and Differences with one other method (Lean Programming)

-(c) involves extensive customer involvement and frequent software delivery
-(D) lean approach incorporates value addition or waste removal as a driving principle for the approach as a result higher efficiency is on the cards.

(5) Situation useful for Lean and Extreme Programming approaches

-Lean : When Efficiency of the resources used is to be prioritized along with other Agile properties. And a value is to be added to the product.
-Extreme : When customer feedback is prioritized for a quick and quality software delivery
