###Feature Driven Development (FDD)

2. FDD is focused on features - client-valued functionalities, the purpose of FDD is to deliver working software iteratively. Big features, that can’t be implemented within two weeks, are split into smaller ones. Distinct pieces of code are always assigned to a single owner. Features are developed by small, dynamically formed teams. Developed features are inspected to detect defects, before adding them to the main build.

3. FDD consists of five processes: develop an overall model, build a features list, plan by feature, design by feature, build by feature.
Develop an overall model: First, domain experts make a high-level “walkthrough” (a description, presented to team members) of the model. Then the overall domain is divided into sub-domains, for which more detailed descriptions are developed. These models are then merged into an overall model.
Build a features list: A features list consists of client-valued functions, that should be included in the system. The functions are divided into domain areas. 
Plan by feature: A development plan for the features is created according to their priorities, classes are assigned to programmers.
Design by feature and build by feature: A group of features is selected from the feature list, these features are then produced, which should take at most two weeks. After the design inspection, coding, testing and code inspection a feature is added to the main build. The next iteration starts from the design by feature step.

The key roles are:

*Project manager*: administrative and financial leader of the project.
*Chief architect*: the person who is responsible for the overall design of the system.
*Development manager*: leads development activities of a team and solves occurring in the team problems.
*Chief programmer*: leads teams of developers and selects features to be developed.
*Class owner*: develops the class he/she is assigned to.
*Domain experts*: has knowledge of requirements for the system and delivers it to developers.

4. Let’s compare FDD with Scrum.
While in FDD development of a feature usually takes at most 2 weeks, in Scrum the development occurs in sprints, which take 2-4 weeks. In both methods, the customer isn’t involves in the development process a lot.
Scrum involves regular meetings, for FDD it’s not required. FDd usually has more formal requirements and the documentation plays a bigger role.
In Scrum, the code is shared, while in FDD class owners are assigned to classes.

5. Scrum, generally, is better when the requirements are changing, FDD - when they are known in advance. FDD allows to “scale” the product better and allows to include new developers in the projects for a short time. It’s easier to use FDD in big teams, for Scrum it might require splitting a big team. Both, however, are good for big projects, because they allow to divide the projects into smaller phases.
