## SCRUM

### Idea

The idea behind SCRUM is to develop in an agile way and near to the customer. It's a software development method typically chosen for a agile, iterative, incremental and prototype heavy process. The product will be developed in many cycles called sprints which have a defined target. After each sprint there should be a working version of the product which the customer can test.

### Process Elements

- **a) Sprint**:
The idea behind the sprint is to finish a set of user stories within a defined period and resulting in a working prototype. It contains( meetings, a feature to be completed, a sprint log, daily scrum meetings, and at the end a sprint review.

- **b) Planning**:
It's necessary to plan the user stories and issues for each sprint to decrease the development effort. Usually, the planning of the next sprint is done at the end of the previous sprint.

- **c) Meeting**:
A meeting can be found inside the sprints as the daily stand-up meetings intended to report the progress of the previous day as well as solving potential problems that occured or will occur in further development and outside of sprints as sprint reviews.

- **d) Product**:
The product is the ongoing subject for all sprints(adding of features) and planning phases, completion rate can be used as an indicator for progress

- **e) Feature**:
A feature is a part or component of the product and is implemented during sprints(subject of the sprint) and added afterwards completely to the main prototype

- **f) Assignment to sprint**:
User stories will be assigned to certain sprints depending on their more general categories and subject of the planned sprints

- **g) Sprint backlog**:
A sprint backlog is an extract of a few selected user stories from the product backlog which will be completed during the sprint.

- **h) Daily scrum meeting**:
A daily stand-up meetings has the target of reporting the progress of the previous day as well as solving potential problems that occured or will occur in further development.

- **i) Release**:
A release is a final version of the product reached after completing all sprints and finish debugging and testing phase

- **j) Increment**:
The finished features of sprints will be added to the already functioning prototype resulting in a new one, making it an incremental development prototype

- **k) Sprint review**:
A sprint review is done after completing a sprint to summarize the work that has been done, unfinished user stories, potential bugs and statistics of the team performance

- **l) Product backlog**:
The product backlog is a list of user stories created at the beginning of the development which should be finished at the end of the development process.

- **m) Prioritization**:
Prioritization is the practice of ordering the product backlog user stories regarding to their importance in comparison with the other user stories. They are stored in a descending way regarding their priority.

- **n) Scrum master**:
The scrum master is the person who is responsible for a functioning documentation and for communication and organization with the team.

- **o) Product owner**:
The product owner is the stake holder of the project, who decides whether features or user stories are implemented correct or not.

- **p) Team**:
The development team work on the user stories of each sprint backlog.

### Comparison with Waterfall Model
As an agile developing model with SCRUM it's possible to react to product changes in a good documented and specified way, which is the biggest difference compared to the waterfall model. Additionally, there is a working prototype early in the developing process which can be tested, which lead to better reaction to specification changes. Both models have a large amount of documentation which has to be done. 


### Areas of expertise for the two models
SCRUM:
- user oriented software development
- development with new technologies
- development for new customers

WFM:
- research and development department
- development for known technologies
- small projects
