# About

This is the ARCADE lecture exercise repository. 


# Structure

Each sheet will be issued in a dedicated directory, e.g., sheet_01. 

<pre>
exercises
   |- sheet_01
   |- sheet_02
   ...
   |- sheet_n
</pre>

You will find both the exercice sheet as well as material in these directories. 

## Issuing

Once a new exercice sheet is available, it will be placed in an according folder. 

## Submitting

You submit your solutions for a sheet `sheet_xxx` in a dedicated (remote) branch `sheet_xxx_<your name>`. Make sure that all of your material (text, code,...) is pushed into your branch before the submission deadline is reached. Material uploaded after the deadline will not be considered.
